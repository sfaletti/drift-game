# Drift Game (a working title)
This is mostly an exercise to help someone learn to write basic games in Processing. At the moment it is a crude space exploration game, but it will likely change over time and could become something wholly different. It includes a cursory physics engine for the ship, basic graphics, and yet-to-be-connected obstacles.

The eventual plan is to port it to an HTML5 canvas.
